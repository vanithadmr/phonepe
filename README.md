Phone Pe Transaction Insights 

Overview: 

This project aims to analyze PhonePe's digital payment transactions data to uncover trends, user engagement, and insurance adoption across geographical distribution to enhance services. Using Python, Pandas, SQL(MySQL), Streamlit, and Plotly, we'll extract insights from PhonePe Pulse GitHub data. 

              Deliverables: 

Extract the data source from GitHub Json format. 

Clean data using python/pandas and convert to data frame and store in MySQL DB. 

Prepare MySQL schema for efficient querying. 

Create the streamlit application dashboard for visualization. 

Business Case study data exploration and analysis. 

Project documentation. 

 

Objectives 

Identify the transaction behavior across the states, quarters, and payment categories for growth and decline. 

Identify device dominance and user engagement analysis to improve app performance. 

Insurance transaction analysis to identify top states, districts, and pin codes. 

User registration analysis provides insights for user engagement patterns and potential growth areas. 

Transaction analysis across states and districts
